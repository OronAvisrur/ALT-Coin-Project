#  ALT-COIN – Educational Blockchain Simulation

🎯 **Project Purpose**  
This project was created for an academic course to demonstrate key blockchain concepts.  
It simulates a cryptocurrency network inspired by Ethereum’s EIP-1559 and includes core blockchain components such as Merkle Trees, Bloom Filters, SegWit, and a light wallet.

⚙️ **Tech Stack**    
- **Blockchain Logic:** Custom enhancements (EIP-1559, coin burn, mining rewards)  
- **Data Handling:** JSON (MemPool transactions)  
- **Execution:** Node.js (no external dependencies required)  



✅ **Current Features**  
- 🟢 Custom Bloom Filter  
- 🟢 Custom Merkle Tree  
- 🟢 Light wallet transaction verification  
- 🟢 EIP-1559-based fee model  
- 🟢 Block mining with reward logic  
- 🟢 Burn base fee (2 coins)  
- 🟢 Priority fee reward (3 coins)  
- 🟢 SegWit (signature moved outside block body)  
- 🟢 Final wallet balances & total coins report
